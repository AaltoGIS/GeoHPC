Activate CSC resources
=========================

To start using CSC computational resources you need to accept beforehand a **Project** in **My CSC**. 
Start logging in to My CSC.

.. admonition:: My CSC!

    To log in to My CSC you need a *CSC account* or *HAKA* credentials.

            ðŸ‘‰ Log in to My CSC

Keep in mind that to having access to a project you will receive a invitation from a *Manager* that has rights to create a project and assign resources. 
You have to accept the invitation clicking in the button *Apply for a membership* and then you will have access the computational resources.

This is how an invtation looks like.

Then, in My CSC go to **Projects** section and you will find the projects that you are currently working. A Project is virtual space 
that gives you access to CSC computational HPC resources (cPouta, Puhti, Allas, and others) and displays the credits you have to use 
mentioned resources named *Billing Units*. The Projects are followed by its registration number and its name looks like **project_200xxxx**.

Open the project you want to use.

In the right side you will find the services that you can access. For example, the available resources in the next image are **Allas** and **Puhti** 
and they display a black switch. The other resources will be shown as unavailable and only *Manager* can grant access.

Be sure that you have granted access to **Puhti** and **Allas** in your project. We will use them in the tutorials.
